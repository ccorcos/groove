# Groove

## To Do
- keyboard play notes -- start all on for and map to numbers with label
- persist scale store to localStorage
- "select chord" block (maj5, minor7, etc.)
- "play chord", "play arpegio" -- keyboard mode
- "sequencer" block -- general purpose!

- create blocks, wire them up, switches, keymaps, select active play block

- "samples" block
