## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccorcos/groove.git
cd groove
npm install
start
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## To Do

- output midi


- scale presets
  - preset button
  - persist stores to local stores
- synth effects
  - knob
  - reverb + other effects


- hints (frequencies, letters, etc)
- midi / osc output?

- synth engine
- design for iphone
- rename to "Groove Salad" + favicon
- Demo video

- better performance when rotating pie?
- keyboard slide offset and the note offset should be a constraint
- rotating the pie should have a min and max just like the keyboard

---

- keyboard play notes -- start all on for and map to numbers with label
- persist scale store to localStorage
- "select chord" block (maj5, minor7, etc.)
- "play chord", "play arpegio" -- keyboard mode
- "sequencer" block -- general purpose!

- create blocks, wire them up, switches, keymaps, select active play block

- "samples" block
- better global layout
- drag and drop root marker
