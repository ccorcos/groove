```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccorcos/groove.git
cd groove

```

## To Do

- scale presets
  - preset button
  - persist stores to local stores

- synth effects
  - knob
  - reverb + other effects

- design for different screen sizes

- hints (frequencies, letters, etc)

- rename to "Groove Salad" + favicon
- Demo video
- keyboard slide offset and the note offset should be a constraint
- rotating the pie should have a min and max just like the keyboard

- three.js better performance?
