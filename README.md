## To Do

- number keys to select presets
- persist presets to local storage
- how to coordinate notes between scale presets?
- press and hold to reset scale
- hints (frequencies, letters, etc)
  - change the number of semitones
  - change the scale to a letter
- synth effects
  - knob
  - reverb + other effects

- design for different screen sizes

- rename to "Groove Salad" + favicon
- Demo video
- keyboard slide offset and the note offset should be a constraint
- rotating the pie should have a min and max just like the keyboard

- three.js better performance?
