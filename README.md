# Groove

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccorcos/groove.git
cd groove
npm install
start
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## To Do

- use mode and inversion scale with constraint
- persist presets to local storage
- how to coordinate notes between scale presets?
- press and hold to reset scale
- hints (frequencies, letters, etc)
  - refactor to use lingo like "mode" and "inversion", using Constraint
  - change the number of semitones
  - change the scale to a letter
- synth effects
  - knob
  - reverb + other effects
- display presets as pies!

- design for different screen sizes

- rename to "Groove Salad" + favicon
- Demo video
- keyboard slide offset and the note offset should be a constraint
- rotating the pie should have a min and max just like the keyboard

- three.js better performance?
