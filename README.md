# Groove

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ccorcos/groove.git
cd groove
npm install
start
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## To Do

- make this work with different scale base number
- make sound with frequency rather
- visualize which notes are pressed
- change number of notes to 12
- touch events



---

- keyboard play notes -- start all on for and map to numbers with label
- persist scale store to localStorage
- "select chord" block (maj5, minor7, etc.)
- "play chord", "play arpegio" -- keyboard mode
- "sequencer" block -- general purpose!

- create blocks, wire them up, switches, keymaps, select active play block

- "samples" block
- better global layout
- drag and drop root marker
